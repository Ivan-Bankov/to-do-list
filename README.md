# To-Do List
## What it does:
A fully responsive basic to-do list made by following a tutorial by Web Dev Simplified The purpose of the app is for the user to make a simple to-do list with the ability to check and delete items. The items of the list are stored in the local storage, so whenever the user closes the app, they can open it again later and still have the same list.
## Technologies used:
The app was built with Reach + Vite in Visual Studio Code.
## Why said technologies:
I wanted to get a basic grasp of how React works with Vite.
## How to install it:
After you've dowloaded/cloned the project, you have to run *npm i* in the terminal to install all of the dependencies, and then run the following command: *npm run dev*. After that, you open the localhost link.
## How to use it:
To use the project, you simply have to type something in the *New Item* box and either press *Enter* or click on the *Add* button. After that, you can check items off the list by clicking on the checkbox to the left or delete an item by clicking on the *Delete* button to the right.
